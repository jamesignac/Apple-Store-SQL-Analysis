# Apple-Store-SQL-Analysis
Analyzing data from the Apple Store using SQL

Using MySQL, I performed exploratory data analysis on multiple csv files containing data about the apps in the Apple Store, including their prices, their ratings, their genre, their descriptions, and more.
This small project is meant to demonstrate my understanding of querying with SQL. 

**FINDINGS**
-- paid apps have better ratings than free apps
-- apps that support 10-30 languages have higher ratings
-- categories like finance, catalogs, books, navigation, lifestyle all have low avg ratings. opportunity in these areas?
-- categories like games, health/fitness, productivity, music all have high avg ratings. more competitive areas
-- little correlation between app description length and ratings, but medium length had best ratings
-- larger apps have higher ratings
-- average rating is around 3.5
